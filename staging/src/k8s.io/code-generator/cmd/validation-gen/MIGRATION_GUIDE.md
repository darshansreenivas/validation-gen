# Declarative Validation Migration Guide

This document is a guide for migrating existing hand-written validation logic in Kubernetes API types to the new **Declarative Validation** system using `+k8s:` tags.

The goal when migrating hand-written validation is to create migration PRs that allow for strict backward compatibility with existing error messages/behaviours and for the 1+ declarative validation migrations tags validated the idea is that in the future the related hand-written code should be able to be removed for a given migration PR.

## Migration PR Commit Structure

Maintainers strongly recommend the following **commit strategy** to ensure reviews are smooth and debugging is easy.

### 1. **Commit #1: Infrastructure Setup**
-   Wire up `doc.go` (enable generation).
-   Update `strategy.go` to call the declarative validator.
-   Create the `declarative_validation_test.go` file with the test harness.
-   Add the initial (empty) generated files.
-   **Goal**: Prove the plumbing works without changing any logic.

### 2. **Commit #2: The First Field**
-   Pick a **single, simple field** (e.g., a top-level `Required` field).
-   Add the `+k8s:required` tag.
-   Mark the hand-written error as covered.
-   Add precise test cases.
-   **Goal**: Establish the pattern for the rest of the PR.

### 3. **Commits #3...N: Iterate**
-   Migrate remaining fields one by one (or in small, related groups).
-   **Rule of Thumb**: One tag/field per commit is often best for newcomers.

## Prerequisites & Setup

### 1. Enable Code Generation
In `pkg/apis/<group>/<version>/doc.go`, enable the generator if not already enabled for that type:

```go
// +k8s:validation-gen=TypeMeta
// +k8s:validation-gen-input=k8s.io/api/<group>/<version>
package v1
```

### 2. Update Strategy
In `pkg/registry/<group>/<resource>/strategy.go`, modify the `Validate` and `ValidateUpdate` methods to use `ValidateDeclarativelyWithMigrationChecks`.

```go
func (strategy) Validate(ctx context.Context, obj runtime.Object) field.ErrorList {
    // ... setup ...
    // OLD: return validation.ValidateFoo(obj.(*api.Foo))
    
    // NEW:
    return rest.ValidateDeclarativelyWithMigrationChecks(
        obj,
        validation.ValidateFoo(), // Pass the old validation function
        nil,                    // Options (usually nil)
    )
}
```

### 3. Add Equivalence Tests
Create `declarative_validation_test.go` in the registry directory:

```go
func TestDeclarativeValidation(t *testing.T) {
    apitesting.VerifyValidationEquivalence(t,
        &api.Foo{},
        func(obj runtime.Object) field.ErrorList {
            return strategy.Validate(context.TODO(), obj)
        },
    )
}
```

## Common Pitfalls & Friction Points

### 1. Short-Circuiting Behavior
**The Issue:**
Declarative Validation (DV) tags like `+k8s:optional`, `+k8s:required`, `+k8s:immutable`, and `+k8s:maxItems` are **short-circuiting**.
-   If a field is missing (and not required), validation stops there.
-   If a field is immutable and changed, validation stops there.

**Hand-written Mismatch:**
Hand-written code often checks *everything*.
-   *Hand-written*: Returns "Required" error AND "Invalid Format" error for an empty string.
-   *DV*: Returns only "Required".

**Resolution:**
You must identify if the hand-written code runs multiple checks that DV would skip.
-   **Check Parent Fields**: If you migrate `spec.template.spec.containers`, look at parents. Is `spec` optional? Is `template` immutable? If so, you must migrate those short-circuiting checks first or replicate the logic.

### 2. Duplicate Errors
**The Issue:**
Sometimes hand-written validation accidentally produces duplicate errors (e.g., checking "Required" in two places). DV will strictly produce one.

**Resolution:**
-   **Fix Hand-written First**: Submit a separate PR to deduplicate errors in the hand-written code.
-   **Then Migrate**: Once clean, migrate to DV.

### 3. Shared Validation Helpers
**The Issue:**
A helper function `ValidateCommonSpec` might be used by multiple types (e.g., `Type1` and `Type2`).
-   If you migrate `Type1` and add `.MarkCoveredByDeclarative()` to the helper, you also have marked `Type2` as declarative (which isn't migrated yet -> BAD).

**Resolution: The Options Pattern**
Refactor the helper to accept options.

**Example:**

```go
// validation.go

type ValidateCSIDriverNameOption int

const (
    // Explicitly identify which checks are covered
    RequiredCovered ValidateCSIDriverNameOption = iota
    SizeCovered
)

// Add variadic options
func ValidateCSIDriverName(name string, fldPath *field.Path, opts ...ValidateCSIDriverNameOption) field.ErrorList {
    allErrs := field.ErrorList{}

    if len(name) == 0 {
        err := field.Required(fldPath, "")
        // Only mark covered if the caller says so
        if slices.Contains(opts, RequiredCovered) {
            err = err.MarkCoveredByDeclarative()
        }
        allErrs = append(allErrs, err)
        return allErrs // Short-circuit to match DV behavior
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Usage in validations.go:**
```go
// For the migrated type:
ValidateCSIDriverName(name, path, validation.RequiredCovered)

// For the unmigrated type:
ValidateCSIDriverName(name, path) // No options, errors returned normally
```

### 4. Renamed or Moved Fields (Path Normalization)
**The Issue:**
Declarative Validation (DV) generated code validates the **specific versioned API types** (e.g., `v1beta1` structs). However, hand-written validation typically runs against the kubernetes **internal type** for that type.  NOTE: this **internal type** usually maps to the **latest version** of the type.

If a field structure changed between versions (e.g., nesting a field that was previously top-level), the error paths will differ:
-   **Declarative Validation (v1beta1)**: Reports error at `spec.oldField` (the path in `v1beta1`).
-   **Hand-written Validation**: Reports error at `spec.newNested.oldField` (the path in the latest version).

This causes a mismatch in the migration check (`spec.oldField` != `spec.newNested.oldField`), even though the validation logic is equivalent.

**Resolution:**
Use **Normalization Rules** in `strategy.go`. These rules allow the migration checker to transform the path from one format (the versioned path) to the other (the latest path) before comparing them.

**Example:**
In `pkg/registry/resource/resourceclaim/strategy.go`, the `v1beta1` version had fields directly under `requests`, but the latest version moved them under `requests[i].exactly`.

```go
var resourceClaimNormalizationRules = []field.NormalizationRule{
    {
        // Map v1beta1 path (spec.devices.requests[i].selectors) 
        // to latest path (spec.devices.requests[i].exactly.selectors)
        Regexp:      regexp.MustCompile(`spec\.devices\.requests\[(\d+)\]\.selectors`),
        Replacement: "spec.devices.requests[$1].exactly.selectors",
    },
}

func (s *resourceclaimStrategy) Validate(ctx context.Context, obj runtime.Object) field.ErrorList {
    // ...
    return rest.ValidateDeclarativelyWithMigrationChecks(
        ctx, 
        legacyscheme.Scheme, 
        claim, 
        nil, 
        allErrs, 
        operation.Create, 
        // Pass the rules here:
        rest.WithNormalizationRules(resourceClaimNormalizationRules),
    )
}
```

**How it works:**
The error matcher applies the regex to the Declarative Validation error paths. If `spec.devices.requests[0].selectors` matches, it transforms it to `spec.devices.requests[0].exactly.selectors`. If this transformed path matches the hand-written error path, the migration check passes.

## Step-by-Step Migration Example

### Phase 1: Analyze
1.  Choose a field: `spec.driverName`.
2.  Check `types.go`: It is a string.
3.  Check `validation.go`:
    ```go
    if len(spec.DriverName) == 0 {
        allErrs = append(allErrs, field.Required(...))
    }
    ```
4. For fields that have additional parent fields in the field path (spec.foo.bar.baz), for each parent you MUST ADD any short-circuit validation tags associated with the hand-written validation for the parent.  These include: +k8s:optional, +k8s:required, and +k8s:immutable/+k8s:update. This involves going through the hand-written validation.go logic for the parent fields and seeing if they have logic related to the list of short-circuit validation tags above (eg: is field foo required?  is it immutable?  if so need to add +k8s: required and +k8s:immutable to it)


### Phase 2: Apply Tag
In `types.go`:
```go
type CSIDriverSpec struct {
    // +k8s:required
    DriverName string `json:"driverName"`
}
```

### Phase 3: Update Hand-written Code
In `validation.go`:
```go
if len(spec.DriverName) == 0 {
    // Mark this specific error as covered
    allErrs = append(allErrs, field.Required(...).MarkCoveredByDeclarative())
}
```

### Phase 4: Generate & Test
1.  `hack/update-codegen.sh validation`
2.  `go test ./pkg/registry/...`

If `VerifyValidationEquivalence` passes, the migration for that field is correct.

## FAQ

**Q: A field was renamed/moved between `v1beta1` and `v1`. How can I use DV to handle this?**
A: DV validation runs on the versioned type. If your hand-written validation outputs errors using new paths, you must use **Path Normalization** to map them. See [Pitfall #4](#4-renamed-or-moved-fields-path-normalization).

**Q: My test failed with "Validation mismatch".**
A: Look at the diff.
-   If DV is missing an error: Did you forget a tag?
-   Is the tag correct? Check for existing occurrences of the same tag.
-   If Hand-written has an extra error: Is DV short-circuiting? (See Pitfall #1).
-   If DV has an extra error: Did you forget to `.MarkCoveredByDeclarative()`?
-   If Origin Mismatch -> Add origin in the handwritten validation code

**Q: Is there a way to add a validation that DV doesn't support yet.**
A: Depending on the situation you can create a new DV tag under validation-gen.  Currently this is has not been done by by someone outside of the direct Declarative Validation working group but is possible for simpler cases where the API is likely straightforward and the implementation is simple.  For example, possibly adding a new format to +k8s:format=<...>.
